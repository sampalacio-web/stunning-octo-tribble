        <strong>About us!</strong><br>
        We are currently <b>1 year, 9 months and 26 days</b> together. Our journey wasn't easy to have come a long way, however our love still remains strong.<br><br>
        Me and her—<b>Sam and Yana</b>, met at school and we were classmates in 1st year high school where it all started. Our age gap is <b>5 months and 15 days</b> making her older than me; It's not necessary to add but I think it's a big deal for us.<br><br>
        We might've had a rough start in loving each other but I'm glad that it's you whom I took risk to and whom I'll be loving forever.

When we finally met it felt like I saw you for the first time again— it felt like my heart was melting finally holding your hands after many many weeks. After that, it made me realize how precious the times I've spent with you and how being with you will always be enough. I am forever grateful that I finally have you in my life, Sam."
